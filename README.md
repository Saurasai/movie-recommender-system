# Movie Recommender System (Streamlit, Python, Cosine Similarity, Dropbox)

This is a movie recommender web app built with **Streamlit**, **Python**, and **Cosine Similarity** using movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, and crew). It fetches movie posters and recommends similar movies based on user selection.

## Features
- **Movie Recommendation**: Select a movie, and the app will recommend similar movies based on cosine similarity.
- **Real-Time Fetching of Posters**: Movie posters are fetched using the **TMDb API**.
- **Dropbox Integration**: Large model files (e.g., `similarity.pkl`) are downloaded dynamically from **Dropbox** for efficient deployment.
- **Preprocessing with Pandas**: Movie metadata is preprocessed using **Pandas** for better recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit** for building the web app
- **Python** for data processing and recommendation system
- **Scikit-Learn** for **Cosine Similarity** computation
- **TMDb API** for fetching movie posters
- **Dropbox** for hosting large files like `similarity.pkl`
